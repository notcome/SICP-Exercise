We have a procedure ``double``:

```Scheme
(define (double f)
  (lambda (x) (let ((y (f x))) (f y))))
```

What is the result of

```Scheme
(((double (double double)) inc) 5)
```

Let's evaluate this expression using the applicative order.

What is the result of ``(double double)``?

It is a procedure who will return a procedure that applies the given procedure for 4 times.
We will call it ``quadruple``.

What is the result of ``(double (double double))``?

It will apply ``quadruple`` twice to its argument.

What is the result of ``(doubles inc)``?

Let's apply ``quadruple`` twice to ``inc``.

The result of the first step is:

```Scheme
(lambda (x) (+ x 4))
```

**This procedure is returned as the argument for the next turn and the new result is:**

```Scheme
(lambda (x) (+ x 4))
```

Below is the output from ``mit-scheme``:

1 ]=> (((double (double double)) inc) 5)

;Value: 21

1 ]=> ((double inc) 5)

;Value: 7
