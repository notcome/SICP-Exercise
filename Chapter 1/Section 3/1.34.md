#Exercise 1.34

Suppose we define the procedure

```Scheme
(define (f g) (g 2))
```

Then we have

```Scheme
(f square)
4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
6
```

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination (f f)? Explain.

---

Procedure ``f`` will apply ``f`` to ``2``. However, ``2`` is not applicable and in the next turn the interpreter will report an error.
