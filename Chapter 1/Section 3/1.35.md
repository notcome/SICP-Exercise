#Exercise 1.35

x -> 1 + 1/x, and we can set up this equation:

x = 1 + 1/x

Solve it:

x = (1 +/- sqrt(5))/2

one of which is the golden ration.

Use the following code:

```Scheme
(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) 
       tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))

(fixed-point (lambda (x) (+ 1 (/ 1 x))) 1)
```

The result is 987/610(1.61803), approximately equal to Ï†.
