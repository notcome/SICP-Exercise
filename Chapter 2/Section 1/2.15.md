#Interval Arithmetic - Less Repeated Variables

It is easy to find that each interval arithmetic operations will increase the
uncertainty, which is inevitable. For example, although ``x^2 + x`` is equal to
``(x + 1/2)^2 - 1/4``, the former expression has one more interval operation
than the latter one. Evaluate both expressions and you will get the latter
expression gives the right answer.
