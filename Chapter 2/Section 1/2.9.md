#Interval Arithmetic - Width

The *width* of an interval is half of the difference between its lower and upper bounds.

For each interval, whose lower bound is *a* and upper bound is *b* (a < b), we have:

```
m = (a + b) / 2
w = (b - a) / 2
a = m - w
b = m + w
```
where *m* and *w* stands for *midpoint* and *width* respectively.

Let's add two intervals, *i1* and *i2*.

```
i1 + i2 => (a1 + a2, b1 + b2) => ((m1 - w1) + (m2 - w2), (m1 + w1) + (m2 + w2))
w(1+2) = (b(1+2) - a(1+2)) / 2 => ((w1 + w2) - (- w1 - w2)) / 2 => w1 + w2.
```

A similar derivation could be done for interval subtraction.

What about multiplication and division?

```
i1 = (-1, 1), w1 = 1
i2 = (2, 4), w2 = 1
i1 * i2 = (-4, 4), w(1+2) = 4

i3 = (1, 3), w3 = 1
i4 = (2, 4), w4 = 1
i3 * i4 = (2, 12), w(3*4) = 5
```

If we have a width function for multiplication, then for the same variables there should be the same results. However, for the above two examples, we have the same input, both (1, 1) but different results, 4 and 5, which implies that there is no width function for multiplication.

Because we can convert division to multiplication, plus we don't have a width function for the latter operation, we don't have a width function for division operation neither.
