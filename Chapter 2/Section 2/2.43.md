#Louis Reasoner and Queens

In Louis' procedure, ``queen-cols`` call is inside ``flatmap``, making several 
repitious computations. For the six-queen puzzles, ``(queen-cols 5)`` are 
called 6 times, and inside each call, ``(queen-cols 4)`` are called 6 times,
and so on and so forth. The queen-cols will be called 6^6 times in all, 
compared with the standard version, 6 times.

But the amount time Louis' procedure will cost may be "slightly" larger than 
6^6T, depending on his implementation of ``adjoin-position``. Mine is O(1), 
but if Louis tries to insert the new row at the end of list, it will 
degenerate to O(n).
