#Iterative Version of Square List

I already faced this problem in Exercise 2.20. It occurs here:

```Scheme
(cons (square (car things))
                   answer))))
```

``cons`` will put its first argument to the head of its second one if the latter
 is a list. As this procedure keeps iterating, new elements will be transformed
and put before old transformed ones, resulting a reverse order.

```Scheme
(cons answer
      (square
       (car things))))))
```

It doesn't work either because ``cons`` is not a list linker. It is a pair 
maker. And it is because Scheme takes recursive pairs like

```Scheme
(a (b (c rest-of-list)))
```

as a list that ``cons`` could add a new element to a list's head.
